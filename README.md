# AI Ops

> The Philosophy, Methodology, and Practice of Operating with AI

## What is AI Ops?

**AI Ops is not DevOps for AI.** It's how humans and AI operate together—across personal life, creative work, family, and enterprise.

## The AI Ops Maturity Model

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Reactive | Using AI tools ad-hoc, no system |
| 2 | Organized | Consolidated interfaces, basic tracking |
| 3 | Systematic | Unified API, observability, documented workflows |
| 4 | Intelligent | AI agents, automated pipelines, memory systems |
| 5 | Autonomous | Self-improving, proactive AI, human-in-the-loop only |

## Core Principles

1. **AI as Amplifier** - Multiplies your capabilities, not replaces you
2. **Unified Intelligence** - One interface to many models
3. **Observability Default** - Track everything, learn continuously
4. **Privacy First** - Sensitive data stays local
5. **Domain Adaptation** - Generic AI + your patterns = powerful
6. **Collective Units** - Family/team AI ops, not just individual

## AI Ops Domains

### Personal
Your individual practice—creativity, learning, productivity, knowledge management.

### Family
Collective intelligence at home—shared access, safety guardrails, cross-generational knowledge.

### Creator
Content pipelines, agentic workflows, maintaining authenticity at scale.

### Enterprise
Gateways, observability, governance, multi-agent orchestration.

## The Tech Stack (Implementation)

```
Open WebUI     →  Unified chat interface
     ↓
LiteLLM        →  API gateway (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Local)
     ↓
Langfuse       →  Observability & cost tracking
     ↓
Qdrant         →  Vector DB for RAG/memory
     ↓
Ollama         →  Local models for privacy
```
